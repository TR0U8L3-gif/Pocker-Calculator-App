After starting the application, we see a huge table of options and two cards.  
By clicking on the color or the symbol of the card, you can set its new values.  
The best move table and cards information update with each new card value.
At the top of the application, we have two black buttons that change the card selection options.
Currently, the application has two options for selecting card: seekbars and spinners.
